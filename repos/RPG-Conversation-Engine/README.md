RPG-Conversation-Engine
=======================

Conversation System for Role Playing Games that allows Turn-Based, Synchronous, Asynchronous character dialog and actions to be defined and performed. I will be building this system in phases, starting with the basics functions, turn-based conversation with no-actions. As I progress the other features will be added; WARNING: There will be a significant amound of re-writing of the engine as I add new features; Some of which will require dropping or changing previous work. Within this repo there will be a folder with previous (working) versions you can still use.
